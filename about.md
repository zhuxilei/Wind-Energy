<h1 id="heading1">What is Wind Energy?</h1>
<p>Wind energy is energy from moving air, caused by temperature (and therefore pressure) differences in the atmosphere. Irradiance from the sun heats up the air, forcing the air to rise. Conversely, where temperatures fall, a low pressure zone develops. Winds (i.e. air flows) balance out the differences. Hence, wind energy is solar energy converted into kinetic energy of moving air. </p>

<p>Wind Energy Converters (WECs) - or short: wind turbines - capture the air flow by converting it into a rotational movement, which subsequently drives a conventional generator for electricity.</p>

<p>Wind energy has been used for centuries to pump water and grinding. The industrial breakthrough for the generation of electricity, came in the 1980s.</p>

<p>Today, wind energy is the most mature of the renewable energy technologies apart from hydro. In 2010, the global installation might reach 200GW, up 5GW in 1995 - that equates to an annual growth rate of 27%!</p>


<h1 id="heading1">How much power is in wind energy?</h1>
<p>When air mass is flowing through an area A with speed v, the power of that air movement at time t is given by:</p>

<p>where ρ is the density of air, which is around 1.22kg/m³. The energy (kWh) is the product of power and time:</p>

<p>To take account of wind fluctuations, the energy from an air flow over a time period P is made up of the sum of wind speeds of small time intervals. Often, average hourly wind speeds are measured, thus providing 24 time buckets per day.</p>

<p>While the air density is more or less constant, the two parameters to watch out for are the wind swept area, A, and the wind speed v. The latter is even more critical, as it is cubed. A location with double average wind speed has 8 times the power for the same area. Or - to capture the same energy, the blades of the wind turbine in the low wind speed location would have to be almost 3 times as long. </p>

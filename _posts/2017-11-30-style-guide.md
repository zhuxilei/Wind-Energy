<hr />
<p>Wind energy propelled boats as early as <strong>5000 B.C.</strong> By 200 B.C., simple windmills in China pumped water, while vertical-axis windmills with woven reed sails were grinding grain in Persia and the Middle East. By the 11th century, people used windmills for food production.</p>

<p>Wind power plants—or “wind farms”—generate power across the US and Europe, and with continuing research and development, wind-generated electricity is comparable in cost to other power sources.</p>

<p>Wind energy is becoming more affordable as technology improves. According to RenewableUK, world wind energy capacity doubled every three years between 1990 and 2002, and with each doubling, prices fell by <strong>15%.</strong></p>

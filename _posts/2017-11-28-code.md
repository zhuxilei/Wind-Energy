<p>Compare this to 4.8 to 5.5 cents per kWh for coal or 11.1 to 14.5 cents per kWh for nuclear power. Wind energy is therefore cheaper than any other new electric generation except natural gas.[which] emits one pound of greenhouse gases for every kilowatt-hour of electricity it generates. The success of this energy is in part due to the fact that its costs have gone "down by more than 80% since the early 1980s.
<p>相比之下，每千瓦时的煤炭价格为4.8至5.5美分，而核电则为11.1至14.5美分。风能比其他任何新一代的发电都要便宜，这种能源成本低是由于它的成本自上世纪80年代初以来已经下降了80%以上。

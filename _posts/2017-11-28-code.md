<p>It replaces environmentally harmful energy sources, and is inexhaustible. It will never be subject to embargoes or "price shocks" caused by international conflicts, and unlike oil fields, wind energy is renewable, year after year, forever.</p>
<p>它取代了环境有害的能源，而且是取之不尽的。它永远不会受到国际冲突所造成的禁运或价格冲击。并且，风能不像油田，风能是可再生的。</p>
<p> Wind energy is cheaper than any other new electric generation except natural gas.[which] emits one pound of greenhouse gases for every kilowatt-hour of electricity it generates. The success of this energy is in part due to the fact that its costs have gone "down by more than 80% since the early 1980s.</p>
<p>风能比其他任何新一代的发电都要便宜，这种能源成本低是由于它的成本自上世纪80年代初以来已经下降了80%以上。</p>
<p>
1.The wind is free and with modern technology it can be captured efficiently.</p>
<p>
2. Once the wind turbine is built the energy it produces does not cause green house gases or other pollutants.</p>
<p>
3. Although wind turbines can be very tall each takes up only a small plot of land. This means that the land below can still be used. This is especially the case in agricultural areas as farming can still continue.</p>
<p>
4. Many people find wind farms an interesting feature of the landscape.</p>
<p>
5. Remote areas that are not connected to the electricity power grid can use wind turbines to produce their own supply. </p>
<p>
6. it provides skilled jobs for people in rural communities.</p>

<p>
1.风是免费的，而且现代技术可以有效地捕捉到它。</p>
<p>
2.一旦风力涡轮机建成，它所产生的能量就不会产生温室气体或其他污染物。</p>
<p>
3.虽然风力涡轮机非常的高，但它们只占一小块地。这意味着下面的土地仍然可以使用。特别是在业地区，种植业仍然可以继续。</p>
<p>
4.许多人认为风力发电场是一个有趣的景观。</p>
<p>
5.没有连接到电网的偏远地区可以使用风力涡轮机来供电。</p>
<p>
6. 它为偏远社区的人们提供了工作。</p>

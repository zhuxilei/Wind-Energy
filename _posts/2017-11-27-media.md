<h1 id="heading1">Wind vs nuclear</h1>
<hr />
<p>The wind power could produce more power than the nuclear power.</p>

<p>Running the math, there is about 6.5 GW of real capacity of wind energy in one year , vs 4.3 GW of real capacity for nuclear over four years. 、That's roughly six times more real wind energy capacity than nuclear per year. </p>

<p>Also, wind-power has a smaller safety  risk.

<h1 id="heading1">Wind vs hydropower</h1>
<hr />
<p>An experiment in Boardman River shows that the wind power contributes  half electroncity of whole Boradman River electronic system. The wind power has two times capacity of hydropower.</p>  

<p>And in the meanwhile, the power investment is quite smaller than dyfropower. In this case, extra money can be used in environment crisis and public sanitation.

<h1 id="heading1">Wind vs fossil fuel</h1>
<hr />
<p>Wind energy isn’t like fossil fuels, which doesn’t discharge pollutants into the air.  Wind turbines doesn’t have the tendency of Asthma, acid rain and global warming.  
</p>

<p>According to American wind energy association, a modern turbine have the ability to avoid 1500 tons of carbon dioxide to be emited.  In other words, more utilization of wind means less problems.  
</p>

<p>Although windmills have existed for almost 1500 years, it’s price isn’t thought to compete with fossil fuels’, however, many utility companies give a price of 2 to 3 cents per kwh of wind electricity.  
If a household use wind energy for 25％ of its need, it will only spend 4 or 5 cents per month, and the price is still dropping.</p>

<h1 id="heading1">Wind vs nuclear</h1>
<hr />
<p>Running the math, that's about 6.5 GW of real capacity of wind energy in one year vs 4.3 GW of real capacity for nuclear over four years. That's roughly six times more real wind energy capacity than nuclear per year.  So far nuclear is losing the race badly.</p>

<h1 id="heading1">Wind vs hydropower</h1>
<hr />
<p>an investment of $17 million in wind power would result in annual generation of 21.9 MWH, while that same investment in re-powering the upper three dams on the Boardman River would result in annual generation of 10.9 MWH.  In other words, an investment in wind power produces twice the amount of electricity as the same investment in hydropower on the upper three dams of the Boardman River.
an investment in wind power produces twice the electrical output as a similar investment in hydropower,so wind power would displace twice the demand for coal-fired power, thus reducing these critical environmental and public health impacts by twice the amount over hydropower.  From an economic, environmental and social standpoint, wind is clearly a better investment than hydropower.</p>

<h1 id="heading1">Wind vs fossil fuel</h1>
<hr />
<p>Wind energy doesn't pollute the air like power plants that rely on combustion of fossil fuels, such as coal or natural gas. Wind turbines don't produce atmospheric emissions that increase health problems like asthma or create acid rain or greenhouse gases.</p>

<p> energy does not produce harmful greenhouse gases or waste products. According to the American Wind Energy Association, wind reduces emissions. One modern turbine could prevent 1,500 tons of carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere in the US each year.  In other words, more wind power means less smog, acid rain, and greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p>Windmills may have been around for almost 1500 years, but it was not imagined that wind power would become affordable enough to compete with fossil fuels. Indeed it has. In fact, many utility services around the world offer wind-generated electricity at a premium of 2 to 3 cents per kWh. If a household used wind power for 25% of its needs, it would spend only $4 or $5 dollars per month for it and the price is still dropping.</p>

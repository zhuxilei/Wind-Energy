<h2 id="heading2">Wind Turbine Technologies </h2>
<p>Wind turbine technologies have evolved over centuries from traditional wind mills to the slick turbines we know today. Developing a wind turbine requires a number of design decisions, starting from the axis orientation, and number of blades to choice of material.
Over the years, a dominant design has emerged, which consists of 3 blades, mostly up-wind rotor, pitch-control for braking and an integrated gear box.</p>
<p>However, in this context, "dominant" does not necessarily mean "best". The best turbine technology for a given project depends on the site's precise wind profile and other requirements. This is why many variations exist.</p>


<h3 id="heading2">Other Design Decision</h3>

<p><strong>Generator & Drive Train</strong><p>
<p>Direct: No gearbox needed, requires a synchronous generator Less noise than with gearbox, but more expensive. Prominent example: Enercon wind turbines.</p>
<p>Indirect: The rotor drives a gearbox, which drives the asynchronous generator at around 1000rpm.</p>

<p><strong>Blade Material </strong><p>
<ul>
<li>Laminated wood</li>
<li>Aluminium</li>
<li>Lightweight glass-enforced plastic - this is most common among large blades - 50 to 100m long. </li>
</ul>
	
<p><strong>Yaw Mechanism  </strong><p>
<p>Yaw mechanism moves the nacelle of a horizontal turbine around its tower into the wind when the wind direction changes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Passive: with a fin attached to the nacelle on the opposite side of the rotor.</li>
<li>Active: with a motor</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tower</strong><p>
	
<p>Steel tube</p>
<ul>
<li>Bending and welding in factory</li>
<li>Long experience</li>
<li>Steel is expensive</li>
<li>Transporting on the ground subject to size limits 4-5m.</li>
<li>Example: REpower</li>
</ul>

<p>Lattice tower:</p>
<ul>
<li>Less steel than steel tube.</li>
<li>Good for high towers</li>
<li>Constructed on-site</li>
<li>Requires lots of inspection and on-site labour.</li>
<li>Example: SeeBa, Suzlon</li>
</ul>

<p>Concrete tower: </p>
<ul>
<li>Less use of expensive steel</li>
<li>Quality problems with on-site concrete. due to changing weather conditions. Alternative: ship segments from manufactury subject to transport limits.</li>
<li>Example: Enercon</li>
</ul>
